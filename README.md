# Jo

The name, Jo, somehow settled in my mind many years ago. The exact meaning of this term is not clear. But I want to use this to build an 'everything' app. 

My day job is a stem-cell/computational biologist. Having witnessed the rapid advancement in the AI world recently, it seems be a perfect opportunity to build such everything app based on LLMs. The tasks or rather modules available in this project will be listed below. Every module would have APIs piped into the central LLM and offer contineous assisstance to everything you wish to do with them. 

## Available Modules
1. Chat (the most obvious use case)
2.
